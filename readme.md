# Chamaland

## Installation

> Unlike Holocraft, I've decided to prebuilt only the multimc file, but you may manually import the modpack into other launchers by downloading the zip file of this repository.

1. Head to the [release page](https://github.com/oOBoomberOo/chamaland/releases)
2. Find the latest version. (it should be the first one)
3. Under the 'Assets' tab, click on the `multimc.zip` file.
4. Open MultiMC and import the zip file.
